# DisasterTweets_KaggleCompetition
Social Media like Tweeter, Facebook and Instagram play a huge role in everyday life. 
It is a big source of information but it is not always easy to understand a person's real intentions,
which can lead to false information and panic.

# Main goal
The main purpose of our project is to construct a machine learning model capable of discerning genuine threats or disasters amidst a sea of fake news.

# Dataset
We are using data from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3cCDGk3Lp4ExV1M4CNy-hRDu8fXc8Pqno1sBpDEHzr1JWog2lxoCRI7j8_aem_AYZB3kUeXJIXS8j73e8LUYSfA8oGcbd_-2ir18kaNF1b2ldTSq3Q3nDRB8dj61hMFs9sDyeeXcvkg57fuFbfMfdQ), which is a dataframe created by figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website.
 In the dataset, the following columns are included:
* id - a unique identifier for each tweet
* keyword -  a particular keyword from the tweet
* location - the location the tweet was sent from
* text - the text of the tweet
* **target** - denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
